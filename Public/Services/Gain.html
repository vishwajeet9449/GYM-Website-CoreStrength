                <p>Weight gain is a process that involves consuming more calories than your body burns, which leads to
                    an
                    increase in body mass, primarily through muscle and fat accumulation. To gain weight in a healthy
                    manner, it's important to focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, healthy fats, and complex
                    carbohydrates. Protein is crucial for muscle growth, while fats and carbs provide the necessary
                    energy.
                    Regular strength training exercises, such as weight lifting, are essential to ensure that the gained
                    weight is mostly muscle rather than fat. Compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench
                    presses
                    are particularly effective for building muscle mass. Additionally, following rules like eating
                    multiple
                    meals throughout the day, staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, and avoiding junk food can help
                    you
                    achieve your weight gain goals in a healthy and sustainable way.</p>
